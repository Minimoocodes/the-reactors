Hi, welcome to "the-reactors"!

This project was created by a group of 4, to practice React. The whole project from ideation to deploying took about 2.5 weeks, and we got to practice the role of scrum master, project manager, and developer. 

In this project, the main goal was to practice the basic component creation, routing, react hooks such as useEffect to fetch API and useState to update the UI, and event handlers for user interaction. 

So we created a mock-up company that offers tech jobs around the world, based on the applicants' preference on the weather. You have the option to choose the weather condition preference, then you're guided to the warm or cold cities' weather info and their job offering. You can also save the jobs into your saved jobs "cart" and delete it, and also apply directly on the page. In the about us page, you can also see the profiles of the creators and their previous individual or group projects. 

Thank you!
